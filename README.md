This repository contains Jupyter notebooks used for training during the hands-on session.

## Dependencies
### Preferred kernel and IDE
***Python 3.7.3 and Jupyter Notebook***

If you do not have **Anaconda/miniconda** on your machine, download **miniconda** from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

If you already have Anaconda/miniconda, you can create a new virtual environment based on the given environment file, `environment.yml` and name your environment. The environment file will automatically download Python 3.7.3 and all the necessary packages into the newly created environment. 
```sh
conda env create -n <REPLACE-NAME> -f environment.yml
```

Go into your newly created Python 3.7.3 environment by
```sh
conda activate <REPLACE-NAME>
```

Deactivate the newly created environment using 
```sh
conda deactivate
```

### Getting started
In Anaconda Prompt (Windows systems) or your system terminal (non-Windows systems), launch Jupyter Notebook by 
```sh
jupyter notebook
```

and go to the directory where you have downloaded this repository.


OR directly open Jupyter notebook server at the PATH with the downloaded repository by 
```sh
jupyter notebook <YOUR-PATH-DOWNLOADED-REPOSITORY>
```
